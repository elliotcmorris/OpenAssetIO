# Same as ASWF CY2022 Docker image: https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/aswf-docker/blob/master/ci-base/README.md
pybind11/2.8.1
# Unit tests
# TODO(DF): Make this conditional (likely requires conanfile.py)

[generators]
# Generate a CMake toolchain preamble file `conan_paths.cmake`, which
# augments package search paths with conan package directories.
cmake_paths
# Generate `Find<PackageName>.cmake` finders, required for various
# public ConanCenter packages (e.g. pybind11) since they disallow
# bundling of `<PackageName>Config.cmake`-like files in the package.
cmake_find_package

[options]
# Without the following, cpython doesn't get installed with all
# artifacts on Windows, e.g. `python -m venv` doesn't work.
# See: https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index/issues/9332
# TODO(DF): However, with the following, the bundled Python interpreter
# doesn't work on Linux because it cannot find libpython (RPATH issue),
# at least when built from source.  We should enable this conditionally
# when we switch to conanfile.py.
#cpython:shared=True
