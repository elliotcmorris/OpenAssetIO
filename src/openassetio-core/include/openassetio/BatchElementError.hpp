/**
 * Structure representing per-element batch operation errors.
 *
 * Many OpenAssetIO API functions take multiple inputs, i.e. a batch of
 * elements, in order to allow the @ref manager backend to optimise bulk
 * queries. The results of such queries are usually returned
 * element-by-element via a callback.
 *
 * It is possible for the whole batch to fail due to some catastrophic
 * error, in which case a standard exception workflow is expected. Using
 * HTTP status codes as an analogy, a client error (4xx) would likely
 * correspond to a `BatchElementError`, whereas a server error (5xx)
 * would likely cause the whole batch to fail with an exception.
 *
 * However, it is also possible for a subset of elements in the batch to
 * fail, whilst the remainder succeed. An exception workflow doesn't
 * work so well here, and so every success callback is paired with an
 * error callback, allowing per-element errors to be communicated back
 * to the original caller (i.e. the @ref host application).
 *
 * The information for these per-element errors is bundled in instances
 * of this simple BatchElementError structure for passing to error
 * callbacks.
 *
 * This structure provides an error code, for control flow, and an
 * error message, for more (human-readable) detail.
