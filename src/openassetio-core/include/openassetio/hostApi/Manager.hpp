  /**
   * @name Publishing
   *
   * The publishing functions allow the host to create an @ref entity
   * within the @ref asset_management_system represented by the Manager.
   * The API is designed to accommodate the broad variety of roles that
   * different asset managers embody. Some are 'librarians' that simply
   * catalog the locations of existing media. Others take an active role
   * in both the temporary and long-term paths to items they manage.
   *
   * There are two key components to publishing within this API.
   *
   * *1 - The Entity Reference*
   *
   * As with the other entry points in this API, it is assumed that an
   * @ref entity_reference is known ahead of time. How this reference is
   * determined is beyond the scope of this layer of the API, and
   * functions exists in higher levels that combine browsing and
   * publishing etc... Here, we simply assert that there must be a
   * meaningful reference given the @fqref{TraitsData} "TraitsData" of
   * the entity that is being created or published.
   *
   * @note 'Meaningful' is best defined by the asset manager itself. For
   * example, in a system that versions each 'asset' by creating
   * children of the asset for each version, when talking about where to
   * publish an image sequence of a render to, it may make sense to
   * reference to the Asset itself, so that the system can determine the
   * 'next' version number at the time of publish. It may also make
   * sense to reference a specific version of this asset to implicitly
   * state which version it will be written to. Other entity types may
   * not have this flexibility.
   *
   * **2 - TraitsData**
   *
   * The data for an entity is defined by one or more @ref trait
   * "traits" and their properties. The resulting @ref trait_set defines
   * the "type" of the entity, and the trait property values hold the
   * data for each specific entity.
   *
   * This means that OpenAssetIO it not just limited to working with
   * file-based data. Traits allow ancillary information to be managed
   * (such as the colorspace for an image), as well as container-like
   * entities such as shots/sequences/etc..
   *
   * For more on the relationship between Entities, Specifications and
   * traits, please see @ref entities_traits_and_specifications "this"
   * page.
   *
   * The action of 'publishing' itself, is split into two parts, depending on
   * the nature of the item to be published.
   *
   *  @li **Preflight** When you are about to create some new
   *  media/asset.
   *  @li **Registration** When you wish to publish media
   *  that exists.
   *
   * For examples of how to correctly call these parts of the API, see
   * the @ref examples page.
   *
   * @note The term '@ref publish' is somewhat loaded. It generally
   * means something different depending on who you are talking to. See
   * the @ref publish "Glossary entry" for more on this, but to help
   * avoid confusion, this API provides the @needsref updateTerminology
   * call, in order to allow the Manager to standardize some of the
   * language and terminology used in your presentation of the asset
   * management system with other integrations of the system.
   *
   * *3 - Thumbnails*
   *
   * The API provides a mechanism for a manager to request a thumbnail
   * for an entity as it is being published, see: @ref thumbnails.

  /**
   * Register should be used to register new entities either when
   * originating new data within the application process, or
   * referencing some existing file, media or information.
   *
   * @note The registration call is applicable to all kinds of Manager
   * (path managing, or librarian), as long as it includes a suitable
   * trait in the response to @fqref{hostApi.Manager.managementPolicy}
   * "managementPolicy" for the traits of the entities you are intending
   * to register_. In this case, the Manager is saying it doesn't handle
   * entities with those traits, and it should not be registered.
   *
   * As each @ref entity_reference has (ultimately) come from the
   * manager (either in response to delegation of UI/etc... or as a
   * return from another call), then it can be assumed that the
   * Manager will understand what it means for you to call `register`
   * on this reference with the supplied @fqref{TraitsData}
   * "TraitsData". The conceptual meaning of the call is:
   *
   * "I have this reference you gave me, and I would like to register
   * a new entity to it with the traits I told you about before. I
   * trust that this is ok, and you will give me back the reference
   * that represents the result of this."
   *
   * It is up to the manager to understand the correct result for the
   * particular trait set in relation to this reference. For example,
   * if you received this reference in response to browsing for a
   * target to `kWriteMultiple` and the traits of a
   * `ShotSpecification`s, then the Manager should have returned you
   * a reference that you can then register multiple
   * `ShotSpecification` entities to without error. Each resulting
   * entity reference should then reference the newly created Shot.
   *
   * @warning All supplied TraitsDatas should have the same trait
   * sets. If you wish to register different "types" of entity, they
   * need to be registered in separate calls.
   *
   * @warning When registering files, it should never be assumed
   * that the resulting @ref entity_reference will resolve to the
   * same path. Managers may freely relocate, copy, move or rename
   * files as part of registration.
   *
   * @param entityReferences Entity references to register_ to.
   *
   * @param entityTraitsDatas The data to register for each entity.
   * NOTE: All supplied instances should have the same trait set.
   *
   * @param context Context The calling context.
   *
   * @param successCallback Callback that will be called for each
   * successful registration of an entity reference. It will be given
   * the corresponding index of the entity reference in
   * `targetEntityRefs` along with an updated reference to use for
   * future interactions with the resulting new entity. The callback
   * will be called on the same thread that initiated the call to
   * `register`.
   *
   * @param errorCallback Callback that will be called for each
   * failed registration of an entity reference. It will be given the
   * corresponding index of the entity reference in `entityRefs`
   * along with a populated @fqref{BatchElementError}
   * "BatchElementError" (see @fqref{BatchElementError.ErrorCode}
   * "ErrorCodes"). The callback will be called on the same thread
   * that initiated the call to `register`.
   *
   * @return None
   *
   * @exception `std::out_of_range` If `entityReferences` and
   * `entityTraitsDatas` are not lists of the same length.
   *
   * @exception `std::invalid_argument` If all `entityTraitsDatas` do
   * not share the same trait set.
   *
   * Other exceptions may be raised for fatal runtime errors, for
   * example server communication failure.
